# Project Status Update - February 9, 2026

## 🎯 LATEST FIX: Clinic QR Chamber Privacy Filter (Feb 9, 2026)

### Issue Fixed:
When patients scanned a **clinic QR code**, they could see ALL chambers of the selected doctor, including:
- ❌ Doctor's personal HOME chambers
- ❌ Chambers at OTHER clinics
- ❌ This exposed doctor's private practice and created confusion

### Root Cause:
1. **ClinicBookingFlow.tsx** was NOT passing `clinicId` to SelectChamber component
2. **SelectChamber.tsx** had no logic to filter chambers by `clinicId` for clinic QR scans
3. Only filtered chambers when clinic was "off", not when coming from clinic QR

### Solution Implemented:
**Two-part fix:**

1. **[ClinicBookingFlow.tsx](components/ClinicBookingFlow.tsx#L456)** - Line 456:
   - Added `clinicId={clinic?.id}` prop to SelectChamber
   - Now passes clinic ID when patient scans clinic QR

2. **[SelectChamber.tsx](components/SelectChamber.tsx#L267-L287)**:
   - Added NEW filter before existing "clinic is off" logic
   - Checks if `booking_source === 'clinic_qr'` AND `clinicId` exists
   - Filters to ONLY show chambers where `chamber.clinicId === clinicId`
   - Personal chambers (no clinicId or different clinicId) are hidden

### Files Modified:
- [ClinicBookingFlow.tsx](components/ClinicBookingFlow.tsx) - Added clinicId prop to SelectChamber
- [SelectChamber.tsx](components/SelectChamber.tsx) - Added clinic QR chamber filter logic
- [App.tsx](App.tsx) - Added clinic filter (for doctor QR path - complementary fix)

### Build & Deployment:
- ✅ **Build Status:** Successful
- ✅ **Deployment:** Live at `https://teamhealqr.web.app`
- ✅ **Git Backup:** Committed with message: "Fix: Filter chambers by clinic when scanning clinic QR code"

### Testing Required:
1. Scan a **clinic QR code**
2. Select a doctor from that clinic
3. Select a date
4. **Verify:** Only chambers from that specific clinic appear
5. **Verify:** Personal chambers (HOME CHAMBER 1, etc.) are NOT shown

## 1. Previous Achievement: Fixed "Drop Out" Analytics Logic
We have successfully restored and redefined the "Drop Out" metric in the Clinic Dashboard analytics.

### Current "Drop Out" Definition (Strict "No Show"):
A patient is counted as a **Drop Out** ONLY if:
1.  They have a confirmed booking (`status: confirmed`).
2.  The appointment date is in the **past** (before today).
3.  The booking was **NOT cancelled**.
4.  The patient was **NOT marked as seen** (The "Eye" button was never pressed by the doctor).

*Previous logic utilizing raw QR scan counts has been removed to avoid data mismatch issues.*

## 2. Key Files Modified (Drop Out Fix)
*   `components/ClinicDashboard.tsx`:
    *   Updated `loadClinicData` function.
    *   Added logic to calculate `dropOuts` based on `appointmentDate < todayStr` AND `!isMarkedSeen`.
    *   Updated the **Practice Overview Chart** to include the red bar for "Drop Outs (No Show)".
    *   Renamed chart label from "Code Scanned Only" to "Drop Outs (No Show)".

## 3. Overall Status
*   **Build Status:** Successful (`npm run build`).
*   **Deployment:** Live on Firebase Hosting (`https://teamhealqr.web.app`).
*   **Version Control:** All changes backed up with descriptive commit messages.

## 4. Next Steps
1.  **Test Clinic QR Chamber Filter:** Scan a clinic QR and verify only that clinic's chambers appear
2.  **Verify Drop Out Data:** Check if the "Drop Out" numbers on the dashboard match actual no-shows
3.  **Monitor:** Watch for any edge cases or issues reported by users

## 5. Technical Context
*   **Database:** Firestore collections `bookings` and `qrScans`.
*   **Framework:** React + Vite.
*   **Hosting:** Firebase.
